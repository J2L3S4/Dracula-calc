# Dracula calculator
I tried to make it look more like a dracula theme

You need to have python installed, ive only tested this on Windows 11 so it should work on 10, for the GNU/Linux guys I don't know, I dualboot EndeavourOS but I'm too lazy to test.

I've only tested on python 3.13 so if you have a older or newer version it might not work (but I think it does unless its a big version difference).

You can just run the calculator.pyw from the files.
